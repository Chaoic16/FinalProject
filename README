A description of the project.

This web page is to bring database with information about games, publishers, develop teams, and platforms for customers to learn about each of them.  
And at the same time, customers will be able to rate and comments on any games that is shown in list.

A paragraph indicating what you think is required for an initial release that has minimum functionality needed to be useful.

Currently I have working links on left section menu for news, about us, and contact us.  And to have a useful minimum functionality I will need to add more pages where it will display
all information in games list, developer teams list, publishers list, and platforms list.  And at the same time,  I also need to add user's registry and login where it will allow user
to be able to registry/log in my website.
